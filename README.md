# Customer-Segmentation-K-Means-Clustering-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this report is to analyze customer segmentation data to identify insights and patterns that can be used to make data-driven business and marketing recommendations. The data provided includes information on customers' number of children, number of deal purchases, education level, cluster accepted campaigns, purchase location type, spending on product type, and characteristics by spending, income, number of purchases. The report will group the insights by each cluster, and provide detailed marketing and business recommendations supported by the data.

## Insights Derived

This analysis aims to provide insights on customer behavior based on the clustering algorithm applied to the dataset. The dataset contains demographic and spending-related information of 5,000 customers. The clustering algorithm resulted in five clusters that were analyzed further in terms of spending, income, number of purchases, average order value, marital status, age, number of children, etc. 

### Overall Summary of Each Cluster by Spending, Purchases and Income
Cluster 0: This cluster tends to spend the least in the median amount ($58) and has the lowest median income ($31.16k). It also has the lowest median number of purchases and average order value.

Cluster 1: This cluster follows Cluster 2 in terms of spending the second most and earning the second most. This also makes Cluster 1 a very valuable customer group to target. Cluster 1 has the same median number of purchases as Cluster 2.

Cluster 2: This cluster has the highest median income ($72.94k) and highest median spending ($1240) among all the clusters, making this a very valuable customer group to target. Cluster 2, despite having the same median number of purchases as Cluster 1, has a higher median average order value of each purchase unit.

Cluster 3: This cluster is solidly in the middle in terms of income and spending at $58.84k and $604, respectively, thus also deserves some attention when it comes to targeting the cluster. It ranks in the middle in terms of median number of purchases and average order value.

Cluster 4: This cluster is second to Cluster 0 in terms of spending the second least and earning the second least. It also has the second lowest median number of purchases and average order value.

### Insights and Recommendations by Cluster Group

** Cluster 0: **

Cluster 0 tends to spend the least in median amount and has the lowest median income. It also has the lowest median number of purchases and average order value. Thus, this cluster may not be a priority target for marketing campaigns (They are also less likely to accept campaigns). However, to increase their loyalty, businesses could focus on providing personalized recommendations based on their purchase history, providing additional discounts or free delivery for frequent purchases. 


Cluster 1:

Cluster 1 follows 2nd to Cluster 2 in terms of spending the 2nd most and earning the 2nd most. This also makes Cluster 1 a very valuable customer group to target. Cluster 1 has the same median number of purchases as Cluster 2. To attract this valuable customer group, businesses could offer exclusive deals and promotions, loyalty programs, and personalized recommendations based on their purchase history. As Cluster 1 tends to be older in age and have a higher income, it may be a good idea to promote premium products or services that cater to their preferences and lifestyles.


Cluster 2:

Cluster 2 has the highest median income and highest median spending amongst all the clusters, making this a very valuable customer group to target. Cluster 2, despite having the same median number of purchases as Cluster 1, has a higher median average order value of each purchase unit. To attract this valuable customer group, businesses could offer premium products or services that cater to their preferences and lifestyles, personalized recommendations based on their purchase history, and exclusive deals and promotions. As Cluster 2 tends to be younger with higher income, it may be a good idea to promote trendy and innovative products that appeal to their preferences.


Cluster 3:

It ranks in the middle in terms of median number of purchases and average order value. To attract this customer group, businesses could offer personalized recommendations based on their purchase history, exclusive deals and promotions, and loyalty programs. As Cluster 3 has the biggest share of customers having at least one child, it may be a good idea to promote child-friendly products or services.

Cluster 4:

Cluster 4 is 2nd to Cluster 0 in terms of spending the 2nd least and earning the 2nd least. It also has the second-lowest median number of purchases and average order value.
